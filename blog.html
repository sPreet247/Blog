        The blowfish puffs himself up four, five times larger than normal and
        why? Why does he do that? So that it makes him intimidating, that's why.
        Intimidating! So that the other, scarier fish are scared off. And that's
        you! You are a blowfish. You see it's just all an illusion. You see
        it's... it's nothing but air. Now... who messes with the blowfish,
        Jesse? You're damn right. You are a blowfish. Say it again. Say it like
        you mean it. You're a BLOWFISH!

        My partner was about to get himself shot. I intervened. He was angry
        because those two dealers of yours had just murdered an eleven year-old
        boy. Then again, maybe he thought it was you who gave the order.

        He has enough money to last forever. He knows he needs to keep moving.
        You'll never find him. He's out of the picture. I saved his life, I owed
        him that, but now he and I are done. Which is exactly what you wanted,
        isn't it. You've always struck me as a very pragmatic man so if I may, I
        would like to review options with you. Of which, it seems to me you have
        two.

        I'm sorry, what were you asking me? Oh, yes, that stupid plastic
        container I asked you to buy. You see, hydrofluoric acid won't eat
        through plastic. It will, however, dissolve metal, rock, glass, ceramic.
        So there's that. How about something with some protein, maybe? Something
        green, huh? How are you even alive?

        That is seventeen five - your half of the thirty-five thousand. Plus
        there's an extra fifteen in there, it's all yours, you've earned it. We
        made a deal. That's right. Because I think that we can do business
        together - we came to an understanding. Take a look at the money in your
        hand. Now just imagine making that every week. That's right. Two pounds
        a week, thirty-five thousand a pound.

        Look... I feel like I'm running out of ways to explain this to you but
        once more, I shall try. This fly is a major problem for us. It will ruin
        our batch. And we need to destroy it and every trace of it, so we can
        cook. Failing that, we're dead. There's no more room for error. Not with
        these people.
